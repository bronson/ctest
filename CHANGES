TODO:
- I should probably get rid of __func__ -- it's not very useful anymore.
- Add routine to parse cmdline args.
  --test will initiate unit testing (optional arg).
     --list lists unit tests,
	 --skip or --run to select tests to run,
	 --verbose to dump a lot of info?  Maybe no need for this one.
	 --brittle to exit on the first failure and not try further tests.
 * TODO: print test results, test suites, etc as they run.
 *    Add a quiet flag that will suppress printing unless a test fails.
 *    quiet=0, full printing
 *    quiet=1, test results not printed
 *    quiet=2, suite results not printed
 *    quiet=3, summary not printed.
- Add some functional tests to check the command line arguments.
- Make sure to try compiling with gcc set to pedantic C99 as well.
- Add support for the NOTESTS macro.
- Make tests check for signals.  int/fp /0 and bus errors.
- Add the ability to temporarily disable tests but leave them in the test deck.
- Add ability to specify an optional timeout.
- There's got to be a better API than show_inversions
