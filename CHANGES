TODO:
- Clean up hierarchy -- split mutest.h, etc.
- Make a MUTEST { ... } macro to surround the test.
  - Make it nestable?
 * TODO: make tests self-documenting.  The test name is the same as the
 * function name, but they should also have a short and long description.
 * TODO: make mutest suites able to be arranged in a hierarchy.
- Try to get the #include <setjmp.h> out of mutest_test.h.
- Do I still use __func__?
- Add routine to parse cmdline args.
  --test will initiate unit testing (optional arg).
     --list lists unit tests,
	 --skip or --run to select tests to run,
	 --verbose to dump a lot of info?  Maybe no need for this one.
	 --brittle to exit on the first failure and not try further tests.
- Add some functional tests to check the command line arguments.
- Make sure to try compiling with gcc set to pedantic C99 as well.
- Add support for the NOTESTS macro.
- Make tests check for signals.  int/fp /0 and bus errors.
- Add the ability to temporarily disable tests but leave them in the test deck.
- Add ability to specify an optional timeout.
- There's got to be a better API than show_inversions
