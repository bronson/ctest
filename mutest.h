 * This file contains the declarations and all the Assert macros
 * required to use mutest in your own applications.
 *
 * To compile mutest to run its own unit tests, do this:
 * 
 * <pre>
 * 	$ make
 *  cc -g -Wall -Werror mutest.c main.c mutest_tests.c -o mutest
 * 	$ ./mutest
 * 	4 tests run, 4 successes (132 assertions).
 * </pre>
 *
 * If your non-gcc compiler complains about a missing __func__ macro,
 * add -D__func__='"test"' to the compiler's command line.
 *
 * See ::mutest_tests for instructions on how to add mutest's
 * built-in unit tests to your application's test suite.
